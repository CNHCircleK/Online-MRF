TODO:
-> localstorage persistant data when jumping between files (saving data locally shouldn't be too much of a risk)
	-> fetching from localdata and repeatedly fetching from database (requests, diff conflicts)?
-> expand form
	-> elastic "Member attendance" section
	-> look at example cerf
	-> tooltip help (question mark next to certain input fields)
-> make MRF support
-> excel integration (load/export)
-> navigation animation?


-> How much data to load? We could load it all (not that much data vs multiple requests), or just load basic info to display then when they click on a card, it calls on the endpoint
